> "Reinventing the wheel is great if your goal is to learn more about wheels."
notes:

I expect must of you have develop web app with any web framework out there. Most of dev don’t know exactly what this things are doing under the hood.

Our goal today is to build our own framework and learn exactly what's going on under the hood. What and why? Decisions? Right? Bad?

At the end we should have a very minimal web framework from scratch (0 dependecies); and understand whats going on under the hood.

Initially I have think for it to be a hands on workshop, then a live coding session but we don’t have much time, so I already wrote all the code and will be sharing it with you. So at the end you can catch what’s going on under the hood.
